        <div class="info">Welcome to <span class="red">Deathmatch</span>!  

            <br><br><br>
            Here, you are placed in an arena with other players
            and must battle it out to the death.  The last player standing wins.

            You spawn with nothing and must find weapons around the arena in order to kill other players.
            More powerful weapons are hidden better and are more difficult to find.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            Games end once there is only one player remaining.  In order for a game to start, there must be at
            least two players in the server.  Once there are at least two players in the server, a countdown will
            start, then the game will begin.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            Each game has a timer.  Once this timer elapses, the borders will close in and restrict
            players to a small area in the center.  The timer will also reset to 2 minutes.
             If no one has won in 2 minutes, the game ends in a draw.
